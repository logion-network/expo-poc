# Expo POC

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the integration of an [Expo](https://expo.dev) app with the Logion platform.

See [here](https://github.com/logion-network/logion-api/tree/main/packages/client-expo#readme) for more details
about how to integrate an existing app.

# Getting Started

## Step 0: configure your access to Logion

If not done yet, copy [`config.ts.sample`](./config.ts.sample) to `config.ts` and change the variables to match your setup.

**Never commit `config.ts` (it is gitignored) as it contains the seed of an account.**

## Step 1: Start your Application

Run the Expo server then follow instructions.

```bash
yarn start
```
